Whether you\u2019re reminiscing about your perfect love story or sitting in a hospital waiting room with bloodshot eyes at four in the morning, simply enjoying the bliss of your morning coffee or making plans to run away from everything you\u2019ve ever known, that friend always has that perfect blend of joy and grief to let you know that you\u2019re not alone. \n \n Well\u2026the music of Clarensau is kind of like that. \n \n Few bands can do so much with so little. The beauty of Clarensau\u2019s sound is found in the simplicity of two acoustic guitars, the blend of the male and female voice, and the subtly found in just a touch of strings. Think Damien Rice meets Eisley or The Swell Season meets Taylor Swift\u2026think The Fray if they traded in the piano for a pair of acoustic guitars. \n \n Clarensau began as the solo project of Tyler Clarensau in late 2004, and has taken many different shapes in the days since. But it wasn\u2019t until he met up with Sally and Tyler Caggiano that the band really began to take its greatest form. The band has over 300 shows under their belt and multiple EPs and self-releases, all which lead up to their official debut album, UNTIL OUR LUNGS GIVE. \n \n Recorded in an Atlanta suburb with recording artist and producer Corey Crowder, UOLG boasts eight emotion-filled songs that sound a lot like a late night sing-a-long among friends. From the radio-friendly melody of \u201cSummer\u2019s Love Song\u201d to the percussive beauty of \u201cComing Home,\u201d from the honesty of \u201cLove\u201d to the frailty of \u201cI Would Trade (Grandpa\u2019s Song),\u201d the sound of UOLG captures the essence of Clarensau\u2026a sound that captivates the passion of the journey of life. \n \n Not allowing music to be the only way to connect with people, Tyler Clarensau has also published two novels, both which center around the music he creates with the Caggianos. For the trio, this whole music thing isn\u2019t the point, rather it\u2019s the means by which they share their story with the world. \n \n So don\u2019t think of Clarensau as just another band with another set of songs and another tour schedule\u2026 think of them as that friend that\u2019s there to help you sing your song.\n    \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."}}}
